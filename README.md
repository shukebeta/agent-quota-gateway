# agent-quota-gateway

Loopback-only reverse proxy for the Anthropic Messages API, sized for
local Claude Code workflows.

## What it is

A single-binary Go server that listens on `127.0.0.1` and forwards any
`POST` to an Anthropic-compatible upstream (Claude Code uses
`/v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens`), preserving streaming and
the `anthropic-*` headers Claude Code sends.

The gateway owns one or more named **pools**. A pool is a set of
*interchangeable* backends — same protocol, same quota semantics — each
holding a real upstream credential. A client never sends a real token: it
sends a **pool name** (via `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, which Claude Code puts
on the `Authorization` header), and the gateway picks a backend from that
pool and swaps in its credential before forwarding. The gateway
auto-rotates within the pool, switching members on a real `429` so one
local user can ride several authorized accounts from a single endpoint
without any client ever seeing a credential.

Everything is a pool. There is no non-pool mode: even a single account is
declared inside a pool. Pools let you keep different *kinds* of account
apart — native Claude subscriptions, non-native Claude-compatible
vendors, and pay-as-you-go API keys each live in their own pool, because
mixing kinds breaks the assumptions auto-rotation relies on (a switch
across vendors loses the prompt cache, and quota semantics differ).

## Scope

- Anthropic protocol only. No OpenAI / Google / other protocols. Pools
  may point at non-Anthropic *hosts* as long as they speak the Anthropic
  Messages API (e.g. a Claude-compatible vendor).
- POST-only. Any path is forwarded to the upstream — the upstream is the
  authority on what it serves, so new or compatible-API endpoints pass
  through instead of hitting a gateway 404. Non-POST methods are rejected
  with `405` before any upstream round-trip.
- Streaming (SSE) is forwarded without buffering — the first event
  reaches the client as soon as the upstream writes it.
- Error responses from upstream propagate to the client with the original
  status code (except a `429`, which auto-rotation handles — see
  [Pools and selectors](#pools-and-selectors)).
- One log line per request (method, path, status, duration, request ID).
  Request bodies, response bodies, and credential headers are never
  logged.
- Pool-based routing. The inbound `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` is a local pool
  name, never forwarded upstream. Unknown or missing selectors fail
  closed with `403` — there is no silent fallback.
- Quota snapshots are captured passively from upstream rate-limit headers
  and exposed at `GET /_gateway/quota`, keyed per pool. No synthetic probe
  requests against the Messages API — header-derived freshness depends on
  real client traffic. The exception is providers that never return
  rate-limit headers (Z.ai / ZhipuAI, MiniMaxi): a background poller reads
  their proprietary quota endpoint for the active member of each pool (see
  [Proprietary quota polling](#proprietary-quota-polling)).

Out of scope:

- Non-Anthropic *protocols*.
- Quota-watermark or concurrency-aware load spreading. A pool switches
  **only** on a real `429` (to maximize prompt-cache retention); it never
  pre-empts on a utilization threshold and never spreads concurrent
  requests across accounts.
- **Cross-pool fallback / manual pool switching** — e.g. "all
  subscription pools are exhausted, borrow the `api` pool for 30 minutes".
  Pools are independent here; choosing between them is the client's job
  (it picks the pool name). A scheduler that moves traffic between pools
  is deliberately not built yet.
- TLS termination (front it with a reverse proxy or `stunnel` if needed).
- Request/response body modification, caching, retries.
- Quota history or per-request metering — only the latest snapshot per
  backend is kept.
- Authentication on `/_gateway/*` — loopback is the trust boundary.
- Docker image or other packaging — `go build` is the deliverable.

## Quickstart

```bash
go build -o agent-quota-gateway ./cmd/agent-quota-gateway

# Declare a pool "auto" with two subscription accounts. The upstream
# defaults to api.anthropic.com, so no BASE_URL line is needed here.
AQG_POOL_AUTO_BACKEND_A=sk-ant-oat... \
AQG_POOL_AUTO_BACKEND_B=sk-ant-oat... \
  ./agent-quota-gateway
```

The gateway listens on `127.0.0.1:8080` by default. Point Claude Code at
it and choose a pool by putting its name in `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=auto \
claude
```

The pool name replaces what used to be a real token — the consumer side
changes only its *value*, not its wiring. Pool and member names are
normalized: `AQG_POOL_AUTO_BACKEND_A` declares pool `auto`, member `a`
(lowercase, `_`→`-`), and the client selects it by sending `auto` in any
case.

### Auth schemes

The gateway picks the outbound auth scheme per credential, by prefix:

| Credential prefix | Sent upstream as | For |
|-------------------|------------------|-----|
| `sk-ant-oat…`     | `Authorization: Bearer` + `oauth-2025-04-20` beta | native Claude subscription / OAuth (also compatible vendors reselling real Anthropic OAuth tokens) |
| `sk-ant-api…`     | `x-api-key` | Anthropic pay-as-you-go API key |
| anything else     | `Authorization: Bearer` (no beta) | non-native Claude-compatible vendor key |

Metering quota on subscription (`sk-ant-oat…`) tokens is the primary use —
those carry the depletable 5h/7d limits worth watching. API keys and
non-native vendors generally do not report quota headers (see
[Quota snapshots](#quota-snapshots)).

## Pools by kind

A pool groups accounts that are *interchangeable* — same models, same
quota behaviour — so auto-rotation can fail over between them freely. Keep
different kinds in different pools:

```bash
# Native subscriptions — the main pool.
AQG_POOL_AUTO_BACKEND_A=sk-ant-oat...
AQG_POOL_AUTO_BACKEND_B=sk-ant-oat...

# Anthropic API keys — their own pool (no observable quota; they fail when
# the prepaid balance runs out).
AQG_POOL_API_BACKEND_K=sk-ant-api...

# A non-native Claude-compatible vendor — needs its own upstream. A member
# may override the pool default (e.g. a regional mirror) with a |url tail.
AQG_POOL_Z_AI_BASE_URL=https://open.example/anthropic
AQG_POOL_Z_AI_BACKEND_X=vendor-key-x
AQG_POOL_Z_AI_BACKEND_Y=vendor-key-y|https://mirror.example/anthropic

# A mixed pool that prefers one member over another. PRIORITY makes the
# pool start on (and fail over toward) the highest-priority healthy member
# instead of a random one — drain the preferred backend first, fall to the
# next when it 429s.
AQG_POOL_CHN_BACKEND_ZAI=zai-key
AQG_POOL_CHN_BACKEND_M3=m3-key
AQG_POOL_CHN_PRIORITY=zai,m3
```

Clients then select `auto`, `api`, `z-ai`, or `chn`. Each pool rotates
independently; the gateway does not move traffic between pools on its own.

### Priority within a pool

By default a pool's members are interchangeable: the controller starts on a
random one and, on a `429`, fails over round-robin (spreading load and
preserving each account's prompt cache — see
[Pools and selectors](#pools-and-selectors)). That is ideal for a pool of
equal-strength subscriptions.

When a pool mixes a *preferred* backend with a weaker fallback, declare an
order with `AQG_POOL_<POOL>_PRIORITY=<nick>,<nick>,...` (highest first):

- The pool **starts on** its highest-priority member instead of a random one.
- On a `429` it **fails over to** the highest-priority *healthy* member, so
  failover always climbs back toward the preferred backend.
- Members omitted from the list rank after the listed ones, in sorted order.
- The variable is **opt-in**: a pool without it keeps the random-start,
  round-robin behaviour unchanged. Listing a nonexistent nick (or a pool
  with no members) is a startup error.

The order is by member nick only — no vendor or model names appear in the
gateway's routing logic, so adding a new vendor's subscription is a config
change, never a code change.

A priority pool also **preempts back**: when a higher-priority member's
quota window resets while a lower-priority member is active, the gateway
switches the pool back to the recovered member so a freshly-reset preferred
backend is drained promptly instead of riding the fallback until it `429`s.
The switch happens within one timer cycle of the reset. It uses the precise
`unified_5h_reset` when known (Anthropic via headers, other vendors via the
quota poller), falls back to the member's parked reset otherwise, and only
idles on a 5-minute poll when neither is available. A member that resets but
is immediately rate-limited again is not switched to repeatedly — reactive
`429` failover keeps precedence. Pools **without** a `PRIORITY` declaration
never preempt, so their prompt cache is never interrupted.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `AQG_POOL_<POOL>_BACKEND_<NICK>` | _(at least one required)_ | A pool member's credential, optionally `=<cred>\|<base-url>` to override the pool default upstream for that member. `<POOL>` and `<NICK>` are normalized (`AQG_POOL_Z_AI_BACKEND_KEY_A` → pool `z-ai`, member `key-a`). |
| `AQG_POOL_<POOL>_BASE_URL` | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | The pool's default upstream; scheme and host are required. Omit it for pools that hit `api.anthropic.com`. |
| `AQG_POOL_<POOL>_PRIORITY` | _(optional)_ | Comma-separated member nicks, highest priority first (e.g. `zai,m3`). When set, the pool starts on and fails over toward the highest-priority healthy member instead of random/round-robin. Unlisted members rank last (sorted). Carries no credential. See [Priority within a pool](#priority-within-a-pool). |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | `https://api.anthropic.com` | Default upstream inherited by any pool without its own `BASE_URL`; scheme and host are required. |
| `LISTEN_ADDR` | `127.0.0.1:8080` | Loopback address only; the build refuses anything else. |

Startup fails closed on: no pools at all, an empty credential, a `BASE_URL`
on a pool with no members, a malformed upstream URL, an unrecognized
`AQG_POOL_*` shape, two keys colliding on the same pool/member, or a
`PRIORITY` that is empty, repeats a nick, names a nick that is not a member
of the pool, or targets a pool with no members. A `|` in a credential is
rejected because the tail must parse as a URL — tokens do not contain `|`.

Pools live in the environment, not a file — the gateway never reads a
credential from disk (see [Security model](#security-model)). If you
prefer a `.env`, source it before launch (`set -a; . ./.env; set +a`) or
use systemd `EnvironmentFile=` / a secret manager.

## Smoke test

With the gateway running and a pool declared as
`AQG_POOL_AUTO_BACKEND_A=…`, select it with a bearer token equal to the
pool name:

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/messages \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'anthropic-version: 2023-06-01' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer auto' \
  -d '{"model":"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001","max_tokens":16,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"say hi"}]}'
```

You should see streaming SSE events back. The `-N` flag is required so
`curl` does not buffer the response itself. An unknown or missing selector
returns `403 {"error":"unknown backend selector"}` without any upstream
round-trip.

## Pools and selectors

A client sends a pool name and the gateway auto-rotates within it. The
consumer never needs to know pool membership — it sends `auto` (or any
pool name) and the gateway routes to one member, switching accounts on its
behalf when one runs out. The model is **sticky, reactive, and
zero-probe**, per pool:

- **Sticky.** Every request to a pool reuses the same member so Anthropic's
  per-account prompt cache keeps paying off. The gateway does not compare
  or balance across members.
- **Reactive switch, no watermark.** A member is ridden until it actually
  returns a `429`. There is no utilization threshold — a member at 95% can
  still finish a small task, and switching only on a real rejection means
  fewer switches and better cache retention.
- **Zero probe.** The starting member is chosen at random on startup (or by
  declared priority — see below) and its quota fills in from the first real
  response. No member is ever contacted just to measure it. This is also why
  resets stay naturally staggered: each account's rolling 5-hour window is
  anchored to its own real first use, so the windows drift apart and there
  is almost always one member freeing up before the others.

A pool may opt out of the random start and round-robin failover by
declaring a preference order with `AQG_POOL_<POOL>_PRIORITY` — see
[Priority within a pool](#priority-within-a-pool). This changes only
*which* healthy member is picked; the sticky, reactive, zero-probe model is
otherwise unchanged.

### What the client sees on a switch

On a `429` from the current member the gateway does **not** forward the
`429`. Anthropic's `429` is a pre-stream rejection, so the gateway handles
it on the response side — no request body is buffered; the *client* replays
its own body:

- **A member is still available →** the response is rewritten to `503`
  with `Retry-After: 1`. The gateway has already advanced the sticky
  pointer to another member, so the client's retry resolves to it and
  succeeds, rebuilding the cache once on the new account. `503` is a
  transient "retry" signal, deliberately distinct from a `429` — Claude
  Code and any non-trivial client retry it.
- **Every member is exhausted →** there is nothing to switch to, so the
  gateway forwards an honest `429` with `Retry-After` set to the precise
  wait until the soonest member resets (read from the upstream
  `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-reset` header when present, otherwise a
  conservative 5-hour window). The sticky pointer is pre-pointed at that
  soonest member so the client's post-wait retry lands on it. An exhausted
  mark clears automatically once its reset time passes.

Each switch is logged server-side as one line — `auto[auto]: a -> b (a hit
429)`, prefixed with the pool name — naming members only, never
credentials or the rejected selector value.

### Reading a pool's quota

`GET /_gateway/quota?backend=<pool>` returns the active member's snapshot
plus an `active_backend` field naming the member it resolved to:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/_gateway/quota?backend=auto
```

```json
{
  "backend": "auto/b",
  "active_backend": "b",
  "unified_status": "allowed",
  "unified_5h_utilization": 0.05,
  "as_of": "2026-06-14T13:42:11.038Z"
}
```

`backend` is the pool-qualified quota key (`<pool>/<member>`);
`active_backend` is the member nick. Because `active_backend` changes
alongside the snapshot, a sudden utilization jump (e.g. 99% → 5%) on a
switch is self-explained: the gateway moved to a fresher account. An
unknown pool returns `200` with an empty snapshot. Pools whose members do
not report `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` (API keys, most non-native
vendors) return empty snapshots — failover still works off the real `429`.
Z.ai / ZhipuAI and MiniMaxi backends are the exception: a background poller
fills their snapshots from each provider's own quota endpoint (see
[Proprietary quota polling](#proprietary-quota-polling)).

## Layout

- `cmd/agent-quota-gateway/` — service entrypoint and integration tests
- `internal/auto/` — per-pool sticky controllers and the `Pools` router
- `internal/backend/` — pool registry, selector resolution middleware
- `internal/config/` — env loading and validation
- `internal/proxy/` — reverse-proxy handler and tests
- `internal/quota/` — rate-limit header extraction and snapshot store
- `internal/poller/` — background poller for proprietary quota APIs
- `internal/logging/` — middleware and tests

### Health

A loopback-only liveness probe is exposed at `GET /_gateway/health`. It
returns `200` with body `{"status":"ok"}` and a `Content-Type` of
`application/json`. The response is intentionally minimal — no version, no
uptime, no upstream reachability check — because the trust model treats
any local process as legitimate.

## Security model

The trust boundary is the loopback interface. Everything that can reach
`127.0.0.1:8080` is considered authorised, so the gateway is safe to run
alongside a single user account without authentication. The guarantees
that follow:

- The gateway owns every credential. Clients never see one — they send a
  pool name (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` → `Authorization: Bearer <pool>`), and
  the proxy replaces it with the resolved member's real credential on
  every outbound request. The selector is never forwarded upstream and
  never logged or echoed — a client that mistakenly put a real token in
  `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` does not leak it through a rejection.
- A credential and its upstream travel together on the request context, so
  one pool's credential can never be sent to another pool's host.
- Unknown or missing selectors fail closed with `403` before any upstream
  round-trip. There is no silent fallback.
- Request and response bodies are not logged, persisted, or inspected. The
  logging middleware records only `method`, `path`, `status`, `duration`,
  and a request ID.
- Credentials live only in the process environment and in memory — the
  gateway reads no credential file, so its "no on-disk state" posture
  holds. How the environment is populated is the operator's choice.
- Quota snapshots are stored only in process memory. There is no on-disk
  state and no telemetry egress; stopping the gateway erases the cache.
- The proxy does not issue probe traffic against the Messages API: every
  header-derived snapshot is the side effect of a real client request. The
  only gateway-originated requests are the background poller's reads of
  Z.ai / ZhipuAI and MiniMaxi quota endpoints, sent with the active
  member's own credential to that member's own provider — never to
  Anthropic, and never carrying request/response bodies.
- The listen address is loopback-only. `config.validate` rejects
  `0.0.0.0`, public IPs, and unresolvable names so a misconfigured
  deployment fails closed at startup.

## Quota snapshots

The gateway watches the `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` and
`anthropic-organization-id` response headers on every forwarded request
and keeps the latest snapshot per backend key (`<pool>/<member>`) in an
in-process cache. Reads go through a small loopback endpoint, keyed by
pool:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/_gateway/quota?backend=auto
```

The unified scheme is what subscription / OAuth (Claude Code) tokens
report: usage against rolling 5-hour and 7-day windows, expressed as a
utilization fraction (`0`..`1`) plus an allow/reject status. This is the
quota the gateway exists to meter. The legacy
`anthropic-ratelimit-requests-*` / `-tokens-*` headers — per-minute
RPM/TPM throttles, not a depletable budget — are intentionally **not**
captured.

Response shape (all unified fields are optional — omitted when the
upstream response did not carry the corresponding header):

```json
{
  "backend": "auto/a",
  "unified_status": "allowed",
  "unified_reset": "2026-06-13T13:30:00Z",
  "unified_representative_claim": "five_hour",
  "unified_5h_status": "allowed",
  "unified_5h_utilization": 0.25,
  "unified_5h_reset": "2026-06-13T13:30:00Z",
  "unified_7d_status": "allowed",
  "unified_7d_utilization": 0.07,
  "unified_7d_reset": "2026-06-14T15:20:00Z",
  "unified_fallback_percentage": 0.5,
  "unified_overage_status": "rejected",
  "unified_overage_disabled_reason": "org_level_disabled",
  "org_id": "org_abc123",
  "as_of": "2026-06-13T13:42:11.038Z"
}
```

`as_of` is the gateway-side time the snapshot was recorded; the `*_reset`
fields are absolute upstream timestamps (decoded from Unix-seconds headers
into RFC 3339). A utilization of `0` means a window is untouched (full
quota); a missing utilization field means the last response did not
advertise that window.

### Pool keying

Snapshots are filed under `<pool>/<member>`, and the read endpoint takes a
**pool** name: it returns the pool's active member with an
`active_backend` field naming the member (see
[Reading a pool's quota](#reading-a-pools-quota)). Per-member historical
snapshots are kept internally but not yet exposed individually.

`GET /_gateway/quota?backend=<pool>` always returns `200`; if no traffic
has flowed (or the pool is unknown), the body carries no `unified_*`
fields. Use the presence of a `unified_*` field to decide whether quota
data is actually available. The endpoint takes no credential — it is a
local read-only view, gated by the loopback boundary like
`/_gateway/health`.

### Freshness model

For Anthropic and other header-reporting backends, snapshots only update
when real traffic flows. The gateway issues no synthetic probe requests
against the Messages API — if no client has hit the pool recently, the
snapshot is stale by exactly that gap.

Z.ai / ZhipuAI and MiniMaxi backends are kept fresh independently of
traffic by the background poller (see
[Proprietary quota polling](#proprietary-quota-polling)).

### Consumer contract

The JSON shape returned by `/_gateway/quota` is the producer-side contract
consumed by [`shukebeta/my-ai-team#588`](https://github.com/shukebeta/my-ai-team/issues/588).
The gateway publishes whatever fields the upstream response carried and
omits the rest; consumers adapt to the shape they observe rather than rely
on a frozen schema:

- Field presence is signal, not noise. Treat missing fields as "not
  advertised on the last response" rather than "zero" — an explicit `0`
  utilization is full quota, the opposite of absent.
- The endpoint returns `200` for known and unknown pools; the caller
  decides whether the snapshot is meaningful by inspecting the body.
- The gateway ships no compatibility shims. Renames, unit conversions, or
  derived values live in the consumer.

### Proprietary quota polling

Z.ai / ZhipuAI and MiniMaxi never return `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*`
headers, so their store entries would stay permanently empty under the
passive header model. Each exposes a proprietary quota endpoint instead, so
a background poller refreshes them on a fixed cadence and writes the result
into the same per-member store the header path uses. The
`/_gateway/quota?backend=<pool>` response shape is identical — a consumer
cannot tell a polled snapshot from a header-derived one.

How it behaves:

- **Active member only.** Every 2 minutes the poller asks each pool for its
  current sticky member and polls only that backend. A pool that has failed
  over to an untracked member (e.g. Anthropic) is not polled until it fails
  back, so polling naturally tracks where traffic is going.
- **Detection by base URL.** A backend is polled when its base URL contains
  `api.z.ai`, `open.bigmodel.cn`, or `minimaxi.com`. Anything else
  (Anthropic, ByteDance Ark, other vendors) is left to the header path.
- **Per-provider auth and mapping.** Z.ai / Zhipu authenticate with the raw
  credential on `Authorization` and report *used* percentages; MiniMaxi
  authenticates with `Authorization: Bearer` and reports *remaining*
  percentages, which the poller inverts to utilization. Both map onto the
  unified 5h / 7d utilization and reset fields.
- **Failure is silent and non-destructive.** A network error, non-`200`, or
  unparseable body is logged and skipped; the last good snapshot survives.
- **Startup.** The poller runs one pass immediately at startup, so a tracked
  pool's snapshot is populated well within the first 2-minute interval —
  without any client request. It shares the process shutdown signal and
  stops when the gateway does.

The poller's reads are the only gateway-originated upstream traffic; see
[Security model](#security-model).

## Why a thin proxy

The proxy is the trust boundary — it owns the credentials and resolves a
pool name to a member per request, and its logs are safe to share with any
local tool. Quota observation piggy-backs on the same boundary: rate-limit
headers come down on every response, so we capture them per backend with
zero extra upstream load.
