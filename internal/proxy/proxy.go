// Package proxy implements the Anthropic Messages reverse proxy.
//
// The proxy is intentionally thin: it forwards every request through Go's
// standard httputil.ReverseProxy, derives the upstream and stamps the
// auth header from the backend the resolver middleware stored on the
// request context, and disables response buffering so server-sent events
// stream as they arrive. Nothing about request or response bodies is
// inspected. Neither paths nor methods are whitelisted — any method on
// any path reaches the upstream, which is the authority on what it
// serves. The loopback-only bind (enforced at config load) plus the
// resolver's selector check are the security boundary, not a route table.
//
// Each backend carries its own upstream URL, so one proxy serves every
// pool: the director reads the resolved backend per request rather than
// a single construction-time upstream. A credential and its upstream
// always travel together on the context, so one pool's credential can
// never be sent to another pool's host.
//
// An optional response observer hook lets the caller inspect each
// upstream *http.Response (headers only, post-roundtrip) without
// touching the body or interfering with streaming. The proxy itself
// stays header-agnostic; quota capture lives in package quota.
