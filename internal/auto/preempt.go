// This file adds reset-driven preempt-back (issue #31) on top of the
// priority routing introduced in #29. Phase 1 made a priority pool prefer
// its highest-priority member for the *initial pick* and the *failover
// target*, but once a pool fell over to a lower-priority member it rode it
// until that member itself 429'd. A member like z-ai resets its short
// window on a rolling schedule and grants a large budget, so to actually
// drain that budget the pool must return to it promptly each time its
// window resets — not wait for the active fallback to burn out.
//
// The Preemptor is a single background goroutine fronting every priority
// pool. It watches when a higher-priority member than the one currently
// active will recover and, on that reset, switches the pool back to it. It
// is generic and config-driven: only pools that opted into priority via
// AQG_POOL_<POOL>_PRIORITY are touched, so equal-strength pools never
// preempt and their prompt cache is never interrupted. No vendor or model
// name appears here.
